    Our place is private, affordable, stand-alone guest house centrally locaated just minuites to French quaters,
    downtown, the fair grounds (Jazz Fest) and city park. Te guest house is a quaint, 400 squaare ft with a full bath, mini Kitchen
    & living room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand 
    made counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax and have a glass of Merlot.
